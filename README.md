<h3>About Me ðŸ˜Ž</h3>

<p>
Iâ€™m Ally Santana, a 21-year-old Junior Developer and Data Analyst, currently working as a Corporate Assistant at TPF Engenharia Ltda. My journey started in a family-run law office, where I helped out with small tasks and discovered my passion for contributing.

An exchange opportunity to New Zealand through the Ganhe o Mundo program allowed me to learn English and immerse myself in a new culture. I taught English and worked in customer service before transitioning into the tech field.

I hold a degree from Resilia EducaÃ§Ã£o and am currently studying Software Engineering at Ampli college. In my free time, I love to create and experience different forms of art.

Thanks for stopping by!
